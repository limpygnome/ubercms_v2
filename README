Request Variables
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Variables can be set in the Data (CMS.Base.Data) object, which can be rendered on the page or used as indicators for template if-statement control blocks. These variables are also used for outputting content. List of reserved/special request variable names:
> 'Page' - the page outputted to the client.
> 'Header' - the area within 'Page' where meta-header content can be appended.
> 'Content' - the area within the 'Page' where content can be appended.

The above names are only guidelines, except for 'Page' (which is sent to the client at the end of the request) and 'Content', which is set if a page cannot be found and no page-not-found handler handles the request. 'Page' will also be set with the template at 'core/page' before rendering and outputtign the content to the client (after request-end handlers), unless the variable has already been set.

FAQ

Q:	Key '/desktop/gnome/interface/monospacefontname' not found in GConf.
A:	Solution from "https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/6410":
	gconftool-2 --type=string --set /desktop/gnome/interface/monospace_font_name "Bitstream Vera Sans Mono 9"

	Appears to be an issue with non-Gnome Arch installations. GConf is basically a key-value, almost registry-like, service; this error means the key at the specified path has not been set, so you can run the above to set it. If that doesn't work, you can install gconf-edit, go to add a new key to / and put the key-name as the full-path above.
