> Consider replacing Regex usage in Templates by scanning through the string. This would eradicate the need to only
replace elements x times. We could scan, replace and start at the position of the replacement (if a replacement occurs).
Thus only n characters would be scanned, as opposed to e.g. 3n as well as the patterns being compiled. This should, in
theory, be far more efficient and faster.
--> We could just scan for <!--....--> manually and apply regex to the ... part.
